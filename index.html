<h1>The world of beauty</h1>
<h2>Beauty in art during centuries and our life</h2>
<div>
<p>Images of Beauty are everywhere. Pictures of handsome men and beautiful women grace the pages of glossy magazines, television, billboards, consumer products and the Internet. In the developed world the preoccupation with the body and with Beauty is intensifying and the Beauty Industry, despite nearly thirty years of feminism, is a <em>multi-billion dollar</em> a year business.</p>
<p>However, <strong>what is beauty</strong>? What do we mean when we say “beautiful” about something? No one can answer this question exactly. So many men - so many minds. Beauty may be physical and spiritual. In different times, people understood beauty in different ways. What do we mean by spiritual beauty? We mean the beauty of person’s inner world, his soul: kindness, responsibility, readiness to help without any reward, friendliness and other traits of character that make a person beautiful in his or her spirit.</p>

<h2>Beauty means…</h2>
